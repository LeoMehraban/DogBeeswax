# DogBeeswax
A Weird Library


Programed in C# over April

Ported to Javascript in November

DogBeeswax - DogBeeswax 6 are C# programs

if you read them, they are pretty self expanitory

but one thing of note, in DogBeeswax 6, there are two Dog classes. These ARE Different

when you create `IndependantDog` you don't yet know the owner, you only know the name and the age. You can add a owner with
`person.Adopt(dog)`

when you create `Dog` you ether know the dog's owner, know only the dog's age or know nothing about the dog

the JavaScript Version is on NPM
`npm install dogbeeswax`

it works in the same way as DogBeeswax 6, just ALL dogs act like `IndependantDog`

and functions have a JavaScript-like capitalazation, `Adopt()` would become `adopt()`

that will be in a seperate repo that i wil create soon

if you want changes, fork this, and make a `DogBeeswax 7` folder for your changes. this repo is read-only
