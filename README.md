# DogBeeswax
A Weird Library


Programed in C# over april

Ported to Javascript in November

DogBeeswax - DogBeeswax 6 are C# programs

if you read them, they are pretty self expanitory

but one thing of note, in DogBeeswax 6, there are two Dog classes. These ARE Different

when you create `IndependantDog` you don't yet know the owner, you only know the name and the age. You can add a owner with
`person.Adopt(dog)`

when you create `Dog` you ether know the dog's owner, know only the dog's age or know nothing about the dog
